Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption, also known as public key cryptography, uses two different keys for the same purpose. The encryption process for symmetric encryption involves a single key, whereas asymmetric encryption utilizes a pair of keys, enhancing data protection through the use of both a public and a private key. Symmetric encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses two keys, a public key and a private key, to encrypt and decrypt messages."

Security in an asymmetric encryption environment comes from two keys. 1. Public key encryption:\u00a0Anyone can see this and access it. 2. Private key encryption:\u00a0Only the authenticated recipient has access to it. Asymmetric encryption relies on two keys. Sensitive messages move through a process of encryption and decryption with public and private keys. * Encrypt:\u00a0The sender creates a message, encrypts it with the recipient's public key, and sends it. Learn more about how Okta\u00a0uses asymmetric encryption\u00a0to protect your organization."
