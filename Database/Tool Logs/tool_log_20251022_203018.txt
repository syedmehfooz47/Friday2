A further GTA 6 leak occurred on TikTok just days before the GTA 6 trailer release date, which included a brief glimpse of the map. Ex-Rockstar developer Obbe Vermeij predicts that \"people might be a little disappointed\" on the GTA 6 release date in an interview with creator SanInPlay, though he maintained it will still \"be the best game out there.\""
